## 💰 Is this data collection?

No, this is only for learning about git flow and the open source contribution process.

## 🥶 Do I need to attach my real name?

No, just put any data or nonsens. We just want to learn about open source contribution.

## ⤵️ How do I retrieve someone's data?

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mazipan/hello-open-source # clone the repo
cd hello-open-source # cd into the repo
node index.js caxvis # will return this person's named caxvis to you
```

Purge all data

```shell
yarn purge
```

You can specify a name(or names) to purge only those file(s)

```shell
yarn purge joe-bob kitty-luvr73
```

**❌ I will purge the data periodically, so please expect your data to be deleted at anytime**

We don't collect data, but there is a chance for other people to abuse your data that is submitted here. Please do it at your own risk, **we don't protect your data**.
